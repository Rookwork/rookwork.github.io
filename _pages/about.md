Hi, I'm Robin. You might also know me as John. I used to work in marketing; now I focus on technical copywriting.

I spend a lot of time thinking about where form and function meet: How can we make things that work well and are also beautiful? 

I'm not taking on new projects at the moment, but please feel free to reach out all the same. Happy to stay in touch: robin (at) rookwork (dot) com

## Work history
I started out going to college for engineering but ended up majoring in philosophy and east asian studies. Practically, that meant I spent a lot of time thinking about how to think and learning to speak Chinese. I even lived in China for a little while. I also made a mobility cart for a cute goat.

My first few jobs were in book publishing. I worked on both the publisher side in marketing and as a bookseller. Eventually, I realized I was my own worst enemy. The more books I got bookstores to buy as a publisher, the more heavy boxes I had to carry at the store. 

I ended up in Portland working as a coffee shop consultant and volunteering as the marketing manager of an anime convention, so I was busy. This is where I started to really get curious about marketing. I dove into lots of marketing and psychology books and pushed my writing to be even more effective in fewer words.

Then, I got an unexpected opportunity: to work at an ergonomic keyboard company. Ergonomics and keyboards were already things I was passionate about, so it seemed like a great fit, and that's my primary line of work to this day.
