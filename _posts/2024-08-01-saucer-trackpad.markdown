This post is actually a link! I made a trackpad that attaches to a ZSA Voyager and I wrote about that. Normally, I would post that here, but since I work at ZSA, it's on the ZSA blog instead. 

So, if you're interested in learning about the Saucer, my trackpad that inspired the official ZSA Navigator line of accessories, check it out here:
